              Oprah Gail Winfrey is my Woman Role model. She was born into poverty in rural Mississippi to a single teenage
              mother. She was molested during her childhood and became pregnant
              at 14, her son was born prematurely and died in infancy. Working
              in local media, Oprah was both the youngest news anchor and the
              first black female news anchor at Nashville's WLAC-TV. Oprah
              Winfrey is considered a role model to many individuals because of
              her tough childhood, wonderful charity work, her schools, and the
              true relationships with her fans. Oprah stands out among many
              people on her ability to feel others' pain and help those people
              get through their troubling times.

                  Oprah continued to work at WVOL in her first years of college,
